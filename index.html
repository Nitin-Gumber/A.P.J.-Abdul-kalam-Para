                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p> <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace
                    scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                    raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
                    four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
                    came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
                    and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                    political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
                    test by India in 1974.</p>
